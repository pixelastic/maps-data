# Maps-data

This repository holds the code updating the data behind the
[https://gamemaster.pixelastic.com/maps/][1] website. The data is crawled daily
from reddit using [reddinx][2] and [on-circle][7], then pushed to [Algolia][3].

The website is generated by [norska][4], with the [search-infinite][5] theme.
The code of that part is available on the [maps][6] repository.
